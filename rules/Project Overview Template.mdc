## 3. Project Structure & Governance

### 3.1. Standard Documentation & Workflow
All project development will adhere to the following standard templates and workflows (AI Executor should reference these for its operations):
-   **Project Phasing & Planning:** Uses `@Enhanced Project Phase Template` for each defined phase.
-   **Progress Tracking:** Uses `@AI-Driven Phase Progress Tracking` for each active phase.
-   **Development Rules & Standards:** Defined in `@Development Rules & Workflow Standards` (This is a separate document you'd create detailing coding standards, commit message formats, PR processes, AI interaction protocols, etc.).
-   **Documentation Flow & Relationships:** Visualized in `@Documentation Flow & Relationships` (A separate document, perhaps a diagram, showing how all project documents connect).

### 3.2. Progress Tracking Links
*(This section will be populated by Cursor as phases are initiated, linking to their specific tracking documents.)*
-   `@[Phase 1 Name] Progress` (Link to the specific progress tracking file for Phase 1)
-   `@[Phase 2 Name] Progress` (To be created and linked by AI when Phase 1 is complete)
-   ... (List placeholders for anticipated phases)

## 4. Development Phases
*(Outline the major phases of the project. For each phase, provide a high-level summary of its goals/key deliverables. Cursor will use the `@Enhanced Project Phase Template` to detail each of these.)*

### @Phase 1: [Phase 1 Name, e.g., Foundation & Core Setup]
-   [High-level goal 1 for Phase 1, e.g., "Establish development environment and project scaffolding."]
-   [High-level goal 2 for Phase 1, e.g., "Implement core data models and service abstractions."]
-   [High-level goal 3 for Phase 1, e.g., "Set up basic authentication and authorization framework."]

### @Phase 2: [Phase 2 Name, e.g., Core Feature Implementation - [Feature A]]
-   [High-level goal 1 for Phase 2, e.g., "Design and implement UI for [Feature A]."]
-   [High-level goal 2 for Phase 2, e.g., "Develop backend logic and API endpoints for [Feature A]."]
-   [High-level goal 3 for Phase 2, e.g., "Integrate [Feature A] with [Dependent System/Module]."]

### @Phase 3: [Phase 3 Name, e.g., Advanced Feature - [Feature B] & Usability Enhancements]
-   [High-level goal 1 for Phase 3]
-   [High-level goal 2 for Phase 3]

*(Add more phases as anticipated for the project. Cursor can help break down larger ideas into these phases based on your input.)*

## 5. Proposed Technical Architecture
*(Provide a high-level overview of the intended technical stack and architecture. This guides Cursor's choices.)*

### 5.1. Key Technology Stack
-   **Frontend (if applicable):** [e.g., PyQt, React, Vue.js, Angular, Web Components]
-   **Backend (if applicable):** [e.g., Python (FastAPI/Flask/Django), Node.js (Express), Java (Spring Boot), Go]

-   **[e.g., Core Engine/Legacy System (if applicable)]:** [Brief description, e.g., "Existing [Language/System] component providing [Core Functionality]."]

### 5.3. Integration Strategy (if applicable)
[How will new components integrate with existing systems or third-party services? e.g.:]
