## II. Rule Definition & Explanation
### A. Rule Overview & Rationale
**Purpose:** To provide the AI Executor (Cursor) with a clear, high-level understanding of how to manage the entire project lifecycle from initiation through phase-by-phase execution.

**Rationale/Benefit:** Ensures a consistent and structured approach to project execution, proper utilization of planning documents, and smooth transitions between development phases.

### B. Guiding Principles for Project & Phase Orchestration

**Project Initiation:**
- Use the @Project Overview Template to document the vision, goals, and initial development phases.
- Collaborate with the user or use AI to populate it.

**Detailed Phase Planning:**
- Each phase must have a corresponding detailed plan using @Enhanced Project Phase Template.
- This includes objectives, tasks, deliverables, scope, risks, and DoD.

**Phase Execution Workflow:**
- Execute phases sequentially, per @Project Overview Template and @phase-completion-before-next-001.mdc.
- Only start a phase once the prior one is marked “Completed” in its @AI-Driven Phase Progress Tracking doc.
- Process:
  1. Locate @Phase-X-Definition.mdc.
  2. Initialize @Phase-X-Progress.mdc.
  3. Execute tasks from the progress doc while following granular rules.

**Adherence to Scope:**
- Focus on tasks within the current phase.
- Log or defer out-of-scope tasks (future features, tech debt, etc.).

**Consistent Template Use:**
- Use @AI-Driven Phase Progress Tracking to document work and DoD.
- Refer to @Enhanced Project Phase Template as source of truth.
- Apply all applicable .mdc rules during implementation.

### C. Examples of Compliance (✅ DO)
- AI creates and uses @Project Overview Template and @Phase-1-Foundation-Definition.mdc.
- Completes @Phase-1-Foundation-Progress.mdc, then starts @Phase-2-Core-UI-Progress.mdc using its definition.

### D. Examples of Non-Compliance (❌ DON'T)
- Starts Phase 3 before Phase 2 is completed.
- Tries to run a phase without a corresponding @[Phase-Name]-Definition.mdc.

### E. Automated Correction Logic / Suggestions
- AI is blocked by @phase-completion-before-next-001.mdc if it attempts out-of-order execution.
- If no phase definition exists, AI should say:
  "To start Phase [X], I need its detailed plan. Please provide or instruct me to create @Phase-X-Definition.mdc using the phase template."

### F. File & Rule References
- **Governed by:** AI operational logic.
- **Utilizes:** @Project Overview Template, @Enhanced Project Phase Template, @AI-Driven Phase Progress Tracking Template.
- **Supported by:** @phase-completion-before-next-001.mdc and granular rules.
