### 1.2. Initiative Statement / Problem to Solve
*(AI Action: Formulate this statement based on discussion. User to confirm.)*
-   [e.g., "To develop a new 'User Profile Management' module for the existing 'Customer Portal' application, enabling users to manage their personal information and preferences." OR "To resolve a critical bug (Issue #XYZ) where the 'Export to CSV' function in the 'Reporting Module' corrupts data for reports exceeding 1,000 rows, impacting data analysis capabilities." OR "To conduct a PoC for integrating a real-time collaborative editing feature using [Technology X] into the 'Document Editor' to assess technical feasibility and user experience benefits."]*

### 1.3. Existing Project Context (If Applicable)
*(AI Action: Gather this information if the initiative is not a brand new project.)*
-   **Project Name:** [Name of the existing project, if this is not a new project]
-   **Relevant Modules/Components:** [Specific parts of the existing project that will be affected, interacted with, or where the bug resides]
-   **Link to Existing Project Overview (if any):** `@[Existing-Project-Overview.mdc]`
-   **Current State/Background:** [AI to summarize or User to provide: Briefly describe the current situation or background leading to this initiative.]

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### 2.1. Primary Goal(s)
*(AI Action: Elicit and list the main desired outcomes.)*
-   [Goal 1, e.g., "Enable self-service profile management for all registered users."]
-   [Goal 2, e.g., "Ensure reliable CSV export functionality for large datasets."]
-   [Goal 3, e.g., "Determine if [Technology X] is a viable solution for real-time collaboration."]

### 2.2. Key Objectives / Success Criteria
*(AI Action: Elicit specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound (SMART-er) objectives where possible. How will success be measured?)*

2.  [Objective/Criterion 2, e.g., "The 'Export to CSV' function successfully processes and exports datasets of up to 50,000 rows without data corruption or timeouts, verified by [Test Method]."]
3.  [Objective/Criterion 3, e.g., "The PoC successfully demonstrates concurrent text editing by two simulated users on a shared document with updates visible in under 500ms."]
4.  [Objective/Criterion 4, e.g., "A documented summary of PoC findings, including performance metrics and integration challenges, is produced."]
5.  (Add more as needed)

## 3. Scope Definition

### 3.1. In Scope (Key Features/Deliverables/Fixes)
*(AI Action: Elicit and list specific items that ARE part of this initiative.)*
-   [In-scope item 1, e.g., "Development of UI screens for viewing and editing user profile fields (name, email, avatar)."]
-   [In-scope item 2, e.g., "Backend API endpoints for `GET /user/profile`, `PUT /user/profile`."]
-   [In-scope item 3, e.g., "Correction of the data truncation logic in `csv_exporter.py`."]
-   [If Bug Fix: Specific bug behavior to be addressed, steps to reproduce the bug.]

### 3.2. Out of Scope
*(AI Action: Elicit and list items explicitly NOT part of this initiative to prevent scope creep.)*
-   [Out-of-scope item 1, e.g., "Password change functionality (will be a separate feature)."]
-   [Out-of-scope item 2, e.g., "Export to PDF format."]
-   [Out-of-scope item 3, e.g., "Full user interface for the PoC chat feature (command-line or basic UI is sufficient)."]

### 3.3. Assumptions
*(AI Action: Elicit and list key assumptions.)*
-   [Assumption 1, e.g., "The existing authentication service (`AuthService_v2`) can be used without modification."]
-   [Assumption 2, e.g., "The database schema can be extended to include a 'profile_picture_url' field in the 'users' table."]
-   [Assumption 3, e.g., "The root cause of the CSV bug is within the `generate_row_data()` function and not an underlying library issue."]

## 4. Requirements & Constraints (High-Level)

### 4.1. Key Functional Requirements (If applicable)
*(AI Action: Elicit core functionalities.)*
-   [FR1: e.g., "The system **shall** allow an authenticated user to view their own profile information."]
-   [FR2: e.g., "The system **shall** allow an authenticated user to update their first name, last name, and email address."]
-   [FR3: e.g., "The CSV export **shall** correctly handle special characters (commas, quotes, newlines) within data fields."]

### 4.2. Key Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) (If applicable)
*(AI Action: Elicit critical quality attributes.)*
-   [NFR1 (Performance): e.g., "Saving profile updates must complete within 1 second under normal load."]
-   [NFR2 (Security): e.g., "Profile picture uploads must be scanned for malicious content."]
-   [NFR3 (Usability): e.g., "The bug fix must not alter the existing user workflow for initiating an export."]

### 4.3. Key Technical Constraints or Considerations
*(AI Action: Elicit technical boundaries or preferences.)*
-   [Constraint 1, e.g., "The new feature must be implemented using Python 3.10+ and the existing Flask framework."]
-   [Constraint 2, e.g., "The fix for the CSV export bug must be contained within the `reporting_module` and not require changes to other services."]
-   [Constraint 3, e.g., "The PoC should prioritize standard WebSockets over proprietary libraries for initial exploration."]

## 5. Stakeholders & Target Users (If applicable)

*(AI Action: Identify relevant parties.)*
-   **Primary Users/Audience:** [Who will directly use or benefit from this (e.g., All registered platform users, Data Analysts, Internal Dev Team for PoC)?]
-   **Key Stakeholders:** [Who has a vested interest in the outcome (e.g., Product Manager for feature, QA Lead for bug fix, R&D Lead for PoC)?]

## 6. Next Steps & Proposed Path Forward (AI to Propose, User to Confirm)

*(AI Action: Based on the "Type of Initiative" and information gathered, propose the most logical next step in the AI-Driven Development System.)*

-   **Proposed Path:**
    *(AI will select and tailor ONE of the following based on Section 1.1 and discussion)*
    -   **If New Project:** "Based on our discussion, this is a new project. The recommended next step is to create a comprehensive project plan.
        **AI Action:** Proceed to create `@[Project-Name]-Project-Overview.mdc` using the `@Project Overview Template.mdc`, incorporating the goals, scope, and high-level requirements defined here."
    -   **If New Major Feature/Expansion on Existing Project:** "This initiative adds significant functionality to `@[Existing-Project-Name]`. The recommended next step is to define a dedicated development phase for this feature.
        **AI Action:** First, ensure `@[Existing-Project-Name]-Project-Overview.mdc` is updated to include this new phase. Then, proceed to create a detailed phase plan: `@[Feature-Phase-Name]-Definition.mdc` using the `@Enhanced Project Phase Template.mdc`, detailing the objectives, tasks, and deliverables for implementing '[Brief Title of Initiative]'."
    -   **If Bug Fix:** "This is a bug fix for `@[Existing-Project-Name]`, primarily affecting `@[Relevant Module/Component]`. The recommended next step is to proceed with debugging and implementation.
        **AI Action:** Initiate the debugging process using the methodologies outlined in `@one-shot-debugging-guarantee-system-guide.mdc`. Document findings, the fix, and validation in a dedicated section within `@[Relevant-Phase/Module]-Progress.mdc` (if applicable) or create a new `Bugfix-[IssueID/BriefTitle]-Progress.mdc`. A full new Phase Definition is likely not required unless the fix is exceptionally large or involves significant refactoring."
    -   **If Refactoring/Technical Debt Reduction:** "This initiative focuses on refactoring `@[Area_To_Refactor]` in `@[Existing-Project-Name]`. The recommended next step is to plan this as a specific development phase.
        **AI Action:** Create a detailed phase plan: `Refactoring-[Area_To_Refactor]-Definition.mdc` using the `@Enhanced Project Phase Template.mdc`, outlining the refactoring goals, tasks (e.g., identify areas, apply patterns, test), and validation criteria."
    -   **If Research/Proof of Concept (PoC):** "This is a research/PoC initiative for '[Brief Title of Initiative]'. The recommended next step is to plan this as a specific exploratory phase.
        **AI Action:** Create a detailed phase plan: `PoC-[Topic]-Definition.mdc` using the `@Enhanced Project Phase Template.mdc`, focusing on research tasks, experimentation, and defining clear deliverables (e.g., a summary report, a small working demo, performance benchmarks)."

-   **Key Information to Carry Forward:** [AI to list critical pieces of information from this document that need to be explicitly included or considered in the next planning document or step. e.g., "Key success criterion: 'X'. Technical constraint: 'Y'."]
