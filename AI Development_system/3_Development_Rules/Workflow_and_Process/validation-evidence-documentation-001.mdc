## II. Rule Definition & Explanation

### A. Rule Overview & Rationale

**Purpose:**  
To ensure every validation activity is backed by clear, verifiable documentation.

**Rationale/Benefit:**  
Documented evidence ensures traceability, quality assurance, auditing, and understanding by others (human or AI). It also supports future debugging and system trust.

---

### B. Detailed Requirements & Specifications

1. Any task marked "Validated" in the `@AI-Driven Phase Progress Tracking` must include specific documentation in the **Notes/Evidence/Link** field.  
2. Acceptable evidence types include:
   - Test report links (e.g., HTML, logs)
   - Commit SHAs for validation commits
   - Screenshots or videos
   - Log excerpts proving correct behavior
   - Summarized manual verification steps
   - Output data/files demonstrating success  
3. Evidence must be **clear and specific** enough for another person or AI to understand how validation was done.  
4. Vague phrases like "Tested" or "Works" are not acceptable.

### C. Examples of Compliance (✅ DO)

**Example 1:** Backend validation  
```text
| Task ID | Description     | Status    | Notes/Evidence/Link                                                        |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.1     | Implement X     | VALIDATED | Unit tests passed. See @reports/phase3/task3.1_test_report.html. Coverage: 95%. |
```

**Example 2:** UI validation  
```text
| Task ID | Description     | Status    | Notes/Evidence/Link                                                         |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4.2     | Render User List| VALIDATED | Screenshot @evidence/phase4/user_list.png. Rendered 5 mock users as spec.   |
```

---

### D. Examples of Non-Compliance (❌ DON'T / Anti-Patterns)

**Anti-Example 1:** Missing evidence  
```text
| Task ID | Description | Status    | Notes/Evidence/Link |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 2.1     | Create Y    | VALIDATED |                     |
```

**Anti-Example 2:** Vague text  
```text
| Task ID | Description | Status    | Notes/Evidence/Link         |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| 2.2     | Develop Z   | VALIDATED | Tested and it works.         |
```

---

### E. Automated Correction Logic / Suggestions

**Detection Pattern:**  
Empty or vague Notes/Evidence/Link field when setting status to "Validated".

**Suggested Fix Description:**  
"Action Blocked: Task `[Task Description]` requires specific validation evidence. Add a test report, log, screenshot, or verification summary."

**Conceptual Logic:**  
Block status change until proper evidence is added. Prompt for evidence or guide AI to generate it.
