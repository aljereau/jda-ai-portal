# Development & Validation Plan

## Coding Standards
- Use PEP8 (Python), ESLint/Prettier (JS/TS)
- Type hints and docstrings for all Python code
- Modular, reusable React components

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for key user flows
- Automated test suite must pass before marking features as complete

## Definition of Done
- Feature meets all requirements and passes all tests
- Code reviewed and approved
- Documentation updated
- User validation (if required)

## Validation Process
- Each feature/phase is validated for completeness, not by deadline
- Regression testing before major releases
