## II. Rule Definition & Explanation

### A. Rule Overview & Rationale

**Purpose:**  
Enforce a strict, sequential development process to ensure each phase builds on a solid, validated foundation.

**Rationale/Benefit:**  
Avoids rework, ensures dependencies are respected, and keeps project momentum clean and structured. Skipping ahead invites chaos.

---

### B. Detailed Requirements & Specifications

1. Before beginning any task in Phase N, Cursor must verify that Phase N-1 is marked **Completed** in its `@AI-Driven Phase Progress Tracking` document.  
2. "Completed" = all DoD checklist items in Section VI.A of that document are **checked and verified**.  
3. If Phase N-1 is not completed, AI must **not proceed**. It should halt or raise a blocker notice.

---

### C. Examples of Compliance (✅ DO)

**Example 1:** Starting Phase 2  
- Cursor checks `@Phase-1-Foundation-Progress.mdc`  
- Section VI.A shows all DoD items as Verified  
- Status: Completed  
✅ Cursor begins work on `@Phase-2-Core-UI-Components.mdc`

---

### D. Examples of Non-Compliance (❌ DON'T / Anti-Patterns)

**Anti-Example 1:** Premature Phase 3 work  
- Task in `@Phase-3-Process-Visualization.mdc` is triggered  
- Phase 2 checklist has incomplete items (e.g., missing unit tests)  
❌ Cursor should block task start and flag Phase 2 as incomplete

---

### E. Automated Correction Logic / Suggestions

**Detection Pattern:**  
Cursor checks Phase N-1's DoD checklist before starting Phase N task.

**Suggested Fix Description:**  
"Action Blocked: Cannot start tasks for Phase [N_Name]. Phase [N-1_Name] is not yet complete. Please ensure all DoD items in @[Phase-N-1_Name]-Progress.mdc are verified. Current status: [Status from doc]."

**Conceptual Logic:**  
Halt task. Report the blocker. Wait for completion or override if system allows.
