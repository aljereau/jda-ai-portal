## 🤖 **AI-Driven Development Workflow**

### **Stage 1: Discovery & Initiative Definition**
```
Prompt: "I have a new project idea: [YOUR IDEA]. 
Let's use the Discovery Method with @Project Initiation & Scope Definition Template.mdc 
to flesh this out over 3-5 rounds."
```

### **Stage 2: Project Foundation & Planning**  
```
Prompt: "Based on the initiation document, create a Project-Overview.mdc 
using @Project Overview Template.mdc with vision, architecture, and dev phases."
```

### **Stage 3: Detailed Phase Planning**
```
Prompt: "Let's plan Phase 1 using @Enhanced Project Phase Template.mdc. 
Create Phase-1-Definition.mdc with objectives, tasks, scope, and DoD."
```

### **Stage 4: Phased Execution & Iteration**
```
Prompt: "Begin Phase 1 execution. Use Phase-1-Definition.mdc and track 
progress in Phase-1-Progress.mdc. Follow all development rules."
```

### **Stage 5: Quality Assurance & Debugging**
```
Prompt: "Use @one-shot-debugging-guarantee-system-guide.mdc to resolve 
[ISSUE]. Log findings and apply systematic debugging approach."
```
