# ü§ñ Universal AI-Driven Development System - Cursor Rules
# Integrated from: https://github.com/aljereau/CursorRulesAljereau

## UNIVERSAL PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Follow 12-folder core structure: project-planning/, project-requirements/, project-documentation/, project-architecture/, project-environments/, project-quality/, project-deployment/, project-monitoring/, project-security/, project-research/, project-assets/, project-integrations/
- Add domain-specific extensions only when needed
- Maintain consistent structure across ALL project types and technologies

## PHASED DEVELOPMENT & OBJECTIVE VALIDATION
- Execute projects in clearly defined sequential phases
- MANDATORY validation against original phase objectives before proceeding
- Prevent scope drift through regular validation checkpoints
- Document phase progress in appropriate tracking files

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS
- Follow language-specific style guides (PEP 8 for Python, etc.)

- Document technical debt when identified

## TESTING & VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
- Write automated tests for all components
- Apply TDD practices where applicable
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Perform regression testing before releases

### Code Generation Guidelines
- Always include necessary imports and dependencies
- Generate complete, runnable code examples
- Include error handling in all functions
- Add appropriate comments and documentation
- Consider performance implications

### Template Usage
- Use project-initiation-scope-definition-template.mdc for initial scoping

- Avoid deep nesting - prefer early returns
- Use meaningful function and variable names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility
- Comment complex logic and business rules

## QUALITY GATES

- Documentation updated
- Performance requirements met
- Security scan passed

### Before Release
- All acceptance criteria met
- User validation completed
- Regression tests passed
- Documentation finalized
- Deployment procedures validated

## AUTOMATION & TOOLING

### Code Formatting
- Auto-format code using appropriate tools (Black for Python, Prettier for JS/TS)
- Configure pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- Use linters to enforce style guidelines
- Validate code against defined standards

### Testing Automation
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Execute integration tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Perform automated security scans
- Generate test coverage reports

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### Rule Evolution
- Update rules based on project learnings
- Version control all rule changes
- Document rationale for rule modifications
- Review and refine rules regularly

### Knowledge Capture
- Document lessons learned from each project
- Share best practices across teams
- Update templates based on experience
- Maintain knowledge base of solutions

# These rules ensure consistent, high-quality development practices across all projects
# while maintaining flexibility for different domains and technologies. 

## MASTER WORKFLOW SYSTEM
# Based on dev-workflow-master-001.md - AI-Driven Development Rule Orchestration
# The ./rules folder contains the complete rule ecosystem for systematic development execution

### CORE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
Follow these 8 principles with their corresponding rule files from ./rules folder:

**1. Universal Project Structure & File Organization**
   - ALL projects follow 12-folder core structure regardless of domain/technology  
   - **Key Rules**: `universal-project-structure-governance-001.mdc`, `initial-project-structure-definition-001.mdc`
   - **Templates**: `project-initiation-scope-definition.mdc`, `Project Overview Template.mdc`

**2. Phased & Sequential Development with Objective Validation**
   - MANDATORY validation against original phase objectives to prevent scope drift
   - **Key Rules**: `phase-objective-validation-001.mdc`, `scope-drift-prevention-001.mdc`, `phase-completion-before-next-001.mdc`
   - **Templates**: `enhanced-project-phase-template.mdc`, `AI-Driven Phase Progress Tracking-001.mdc`

**3. Comprehensive Validation & Rigorous Testing**
   - Components validated with automated tests, edge cases, TDD practices
   - **Key Rules**: `automated-test-requirements-001.mdc`, `test-driven-development-adherence-001.mdc`, `component-validation-before-advancement-001.mdc`, `validation-evidence-documentation-001.mdc`

**4. High Code Quality, Style & Maintainability**
   - Adhere to style guides, type hints, comprehensive docstrings
   - **Key Rules**: `code-quality-pep8-python-001.mdc`, `code-quality-typehints-python-001.mdc`, `code-docstring-standard-python-001.mdc`, `technical-debt-logging-format-001.mdc`

**5. Architectural Integrity & Robust Design**
   - Preserve core system integrity, use service layer wrappers
   - **Key Rules**: `backend-integrity-no-direct-modification-001.mdc`, `backend-service-layer-wrappers-001.mdc`

**6. Standardized Version Control & Integration**
   - Atomic commits, branching strategy, PR/MR processes
   - **Key Rules**: `branching-strategy-feature-format-001.mdc`, `commit-standard-format-001.mdc`, `no-direct-commits-main-protected-001.mdc`, `pr-mr-required-for-integration-001.mdc`

**7. Consistent & Timely Documentation**
   - Keep READMEs, technical docs updated with development progress
   - **Key Rules**: `readme-update-per-phase-001.mdc`, `technical-doc-update-milestones-001.mdc`

**8. Systematic Issue, Bug & Patch Management**
   - Immediate logging, root cause analysis, thorough validation
   - **Key Rules**: `issue-blocker-immediate-logging-001.mdc`, `One-Shot Debugging Guarantee System.mdc`

### AI EXECUTOR WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE

**‚úÖ DO - Examples of Proper Execution:**
- Validate ALL development work against original phase objectives before proceeding
- Maintain universal project structure with 12-folder core + domain extensions
- Use established templates for planning: `project-initiation-scope-definition.mdc`, `enhanced-project-phase-template.mdc`
- Follow debugging methodology from `One-Shot Debugging Guarantee System.mdc`
- Complete Phase Progress documents with all DoD items met

**‚ùå DON'T - Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Building features not defined in original phase objectives without validation
- Generating code that violates PEP 8 without attempting fixes
- Committing directly to main branch without PR
- Proceeding to new phase before previous DoD completion
- Using inconsistent project structure across project types

### MASTER RULE ORCHESTRATION
- **Primary Reference**: `dev-workflow-master-001.md` (contains complete rule mapping)
- **Documentation Templates**: Use established templates for all planning and tracking
- **Rule Relationships**: Each principle maps to specific supporting rules in ./rules folder
- **Validation Required**: Always validate work against original objectives before advancement

### CONTEXT-AWARE RULE APPLICATION
1. **Project Start**: Universal structure + initiation templates
2. **Phase Planning**: Phase templates + objective validation rules  
3. **Python Development**: PEP8 + type hints + docstring rules
4. **Backend Work**: Integrity + service wrapper rules
5. **Testing**: Automated test + TDD + validation rules
6. **Version Control**: Branching + commit + PR/MR rules
7. **Documentation**: README + technical doc rules
8. **Debugging**: Framework + one-shot debugging rules

This system ensures consistent, high-quality development while preventing scope drift and maintaining architectural integrity across ALL projects.
