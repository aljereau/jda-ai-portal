# AI-Driven Knowledge Refinement Workflow

## Vision

Transform all raw project information—transcripts, emails, documents, Notion pages, workflow docs, SOPs, etc.—into a clean, structured, and always up-to-date knowledge base using AI. This enables fast, accurate proposal and project document generation, smarter search, and effortless updates.

## How It Works

1. **Raw Data Ingestion**
   - Users upload or connect raw sources: transcripts, emails, PDFs, DOCX, Notion pages, workflow docs, SOPs, etc.
   - Multiple formats and sources are supported.

2. **AI-Driven Processing & Refinement**
   - AI reads and analyzes the raw input.
   - Extracts key information, removes noise, and organizes content.
   - Creates "refined documents" (summaries, structured notes, requirements, action items, etc.).

3. **Automated Tagging & Categorization**
   - AI automatically tags each refined document with relevant categories (e.g., "Client Requirements", "Budget", "Timeline", "SOP", "Discovery Phase").
   - Users can review, edit, or add tags as needed.

4. **Central Knowledge Base**
   - All refined documents are stored in a searchable, filterable repository.
   - Each refined document links back to its original raw source(s) for traceability.

5. **Continuous Updates & Versioning**
   - When new raw data is uploaded (e.g., a new meeting transcript or updated SOP), the AI updates the relevant refined document.
   - Version history is maintained for audit and reference.

6. **Downstream Usage**
   - Proposal and project document generation pulls from the latest, AI-refined, and tagged documents.
   - AI Q&A and search use the structured knowledge base for more accurate answers.

## Example Workflow

1. Upload a raw transcript and a workflow doc.
2. AI processes both, creating a "Discovery Meeting Summary" and a "Workflow Overview" refined doc, tagging them appropriately.
3. Later, upload a new version of the workflow doc. AI updates the "Workflow Overview" refined doc, maintaining version history.
4. When generating a proposal, the system pulls the latest, tagged, refined docs for each section.

## Benefits

- **Always Clean, Structured Data:** No more sifting through messy raw files—everything is organized and ready to use.
- **Automated Tagging & Categorization:** Ensures consistency and makes retrieval easy.
- **Traceability & Auditability:** Every refined doc links back to its original source.
- **Effortless Updates:** Refined docs are easily updated as new information comes in.
- **Smarter AI Assistance:** The AI works with high-quality, structured data, making proposal generation and Q&A more accurate and relevant.

## UI/UX Suggestions

- **Raw Upload Area:** For all file types and sources.
- **Refined Documents List:** Shows all AI-processed, tagged docs.
- **Tag & Edit Panel:** Review and adjust tags or content.
- **Version History:** View and restore previous versions of refined docs.
- **Link to Source:** Quick access to the original raw data.

## Advanced Features & Enhancements

1. **Access Control & Permissions**
   - Define who can upload, edit, tag, or delete knowledge items.
   - Restrict certain documents/tags to specific roles or environments.

2. **Automated Quality Checks**
   - AI or system flags low-quality, incomplete, or duplicate uploads.
   - Suggestions for missing tags or required metadata.

3. **Feedback & Correction Loop**
   - Users can flag errors or suggest improvements to AI-refined documents.
   - AI learns from corrections to improve future processing.

4. **Integration with External Knowledge Sources**
   - Sync with external knowledge bases (e.g., SharePoint, Confluence, Google Drive) for continuous updates.

5. **Bulk Operations**
   - Bulk upload, tagging, or editing for large projects or migrations.

6. **Export & Sharing**
   - Export refined documents or knowledge base slices for sharing with clients or external partners.

7. **Audit Logs & Activity Tracking**
   - Track who uploaded, edited, or tagged each document and when.

8. **AI Explainability**
   - Option to see "why" the AI tagged or summarized something a certain way (transparency for users).

9. **Custom Tag Taxonomies**
   - Support for hierarchical or custom tag structures (e.g., "Phase > Discovery > Requirements").

10. **Notifications & Reminders**
    - Notify users when new knowledge is added, or when a document needs review/update.
