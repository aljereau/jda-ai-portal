# Project Initiation & Scope Definition: JDA AI-Guided Project Portal

## 1. Initiative Overview

### 1.1. Type of Initiative
- [x] **New Project/Application:** (Building something from scratch)
- [ ] **New Major Feature:** (Adding significant new functionality to an existing project)
- [ ] **Feature Expansion/Enhancement:** (Improving or adding to an existing feature)
- [ ] **Bug Fix:** (Addressing a defect in existing functionality)
- [ ] **Refactoring/Technical Debt Reduction:** (Improving code quality, performance, or architecture without new user-facing features)
- [ ] **Research/Proof of Concept (PoC):** (Exploring feasibility or a new technology)

**Elaboration:** Building a comprehensive AI-guided project portal from scratch that serves as a dynamic collaboration hub for JDA's AI consultancy work, starting with proposal generation and evolving into full project management throughout the client lifecycle.

### 1.2. Initiative Statement / Problem to Solve
To develop a dynamic, AI-guided project portal that eliminates fragmented project management across multiple tools (Notion, Slack, email, PDFs) by creating client-specific collaboration hubs that evolve from initial proposals into comprehensive project management platforms with AI integration, real-time collaboration, and centralized deliverable tracking.

### 1.3. Existing Project Context (If Applicable)
**Project Name:** N/A - New Project
**Relevant Modules/Components:** N/A - Greenfield Development
**Link to Existing Project Overview:** N/A
**Current State/Background:** JDA currently manages AI consultancy projects across fragmented tools causing opacity, poor client experience, and inefficient project tracking. Need centralized, AI-enhanced solution that grows with each project phase.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### 2.1. Primary Goal(s)
- Create unified project portal that serves both JDA internal team and clients
- Eliminate tool fragmentation and improve project transparency 
- Enable AI-guided project structuring and phase management
- Build scalable platform for JDA's AI consultancy business growth

### 2.2. Key Objectives / Success Criteria
1. **Phase 0 Success:** Generate dynamic proposal pages from meeting transcripts that convert to live project portals by end of Phase 1
2. **Integration Success:** Successfully connect with existing tools (Slack, Notion, Google Drive, Read.ai) without forcing behavior change by Phase 2
3. **AI Intelligence:** AI co-pilot accurately summarizes meetings, suggests next steps, and detects project misalignment by Phase 2
4. **Client Experience:** Non-technical clients can easily navigate portal, provide feedback, and track deliverables with 90%+ satisfaction
5. **Business Impact:** Reduce project management overhead by 40% and improve client retention through enhanced transparency

## 3. Scope Definition

### 3.1. In Scope (Key Features/Deliverables)
**Phase 0: Intake & Proposal**
- Client intake form and portal generator
- Meeting transcription integration (Read.ai)
- AI-powered meeting summarizer
- Dynamic proposal generator with smart templates
- Live proposal pages with clickable phase cards
- PDF export capability

**Phase 1: Exploration & Discovery**
- Dashboard mock-up builder
- Workflow analysis module with document upload
- AI readiness assessment engine
- Project landscape generator
- Client feedback threads per insight

**Phase 2: Design & Build**
- Module breakdown engine with AI suggestions
- Timeline creator (Gantt-style)
- Deliverables tracker with live status
- Dev tasks + integration notes (internal view)
- Linked references to external tools

**Phase 3: Deployment & Post-Launch**
- Rollout checklist (shared view)
- AI system handbook generator
- Retainer toggle functionality
- Request center for feature additions
- Impact tracker with ROI stats

**Always-On Features**
- Tool integrations (Slack, Notion, Google ecosystem)
- AI co-pilot for summarization and guidance
- Access control (team vs client roles)
- Internal analytics dashboard
- Client overview dashboard

### 3.2. Out of Scope
- Replacement of existing tools (integration-focused approach)
- Multi-language support (Phase 1)
- White-label version for other agencies
- Invoicing integration (Phase 1)
- Mobile app development (Phase 1)
- Advanced API access for third parties

### 3.3. Assumptions
- Read.ai integration will remain stable and accessible
- Clients will adopt portal usage alongside existing tool workflows
- JDA team has bandwidth for phased rollout and user feedback incorporation
- Integration APIs (Slack, Notion, Google) will remain accessible
- Initial client base will provide feedback for iterative improvement

## 4. Requirements & Constraints (High-Level)

### 4.1. Key Functional Requirements
- **FR1:** System shall generate proposal pages from meeting transcripts within 24 hours
- **FR2:** System shall provide real-time sync with integrated tools without data duplication
- **FR3:** System shall enable role-based access control for team vs client views
- **FR4:** System shall track project phases with automated status updates
- **FR5:** AI co-pilot shall provide contextual suggestions based on project data

### 4.2. Key Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- **NFR1 (Performance):** Portal pages must load within 2 seconds under normal load
- **NFR2 (Security):** All client data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **NFR3 (Usability):** Non-technical users must complete key tasks without training
- **NFR4 (Scalability):** System must support 50+ concurrent projects by Phase 2
- **NFR5 (Reliability):** 99.5% uptime during business hours

### 4.3. Key Technical Constraints or Considerations
- Must integrate with existing JDA tech stack and tools
- Python/JavaScript preferred for development consistency
- Cloud-hosted solution for accessibility and scalability
- API-first design for future integrations
- Mobile-responsive design for client accessibility

## 5. Stakeholders & Target Users

**Primary Users/Audience:**
- JDA Internal Team (project managers, AI developers, operations)
- JDA Clients (decision-makers, stakeholders, operators)

**Key Stakeholders:**
- JDA Leadership (business strategy and growth)
- Development Team (technical implementation)
- Client Success Team (user experience and adoption)
- Current JDA Clients (feedback and validation)

## 6. Next Steps & Proposed Path Forward

**Proposed Path:**
Based on our discussion, this is a new project with significant complexity and multiple phases. The recommended next step is to create a comprehensive project plan.

**AI Action:** Proceed to create `JDA-AI-Project-Portal-Overview.mdc` using the `Project Overview Template.mdc`, incorporating:
- Detailed technical architecture decisions
- Complete phase breakdown with dependencies
- Resource allocation and timeline estimates  
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and validation criteria

**Key Information to Carry Forward:**
- **Core Philosophy:** Integration-focused, not replacement-focused approach
- **Critical Success Criterion:** Non-technical client adoption with 90%+ satisfaction
- **Technical Constraint:** Must work with existing JDA tool ecosystem
- **Business Objective:** 40% reduction in project management overhead
- **Scalability Target:** Support 50+ concurrent projects by Phase 2
