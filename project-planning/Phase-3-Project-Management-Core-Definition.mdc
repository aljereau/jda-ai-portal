# Phase 3: Project Management Core Features - Definition

## Overview

This phase focuses on implementing the core business functionality of the JDA AI-Guided Project Portal: project creation, proposal generation, client management, and dynamic project hubs. The goal is to deliver the primary value proposition that enables JDA consultancy operations to efficiently manage projects from intake through deployment phases.

## Objectives

1. **AI-Powered Proposal Generation Pipeline** - Complete transcript → summary → proposal workflow with review/edit capabilities
2. **Proposal Template Engine** - Dynamic proposal generation using existing JDA_CasBon_Proposal.html template
3. **Proposal Expansion System** - User-controlled proposal editing with block addition/removal features
4. **Proposal Database & Management** - Storage, retrieval, and version management for all generated proposals
5. **Basic Project Tracking** - Simple 4-phase project lifecycle tied to proposals (Exploratory → Discovery → Development → Deployment)
6. **Client Portal Interface** - Read-only client access to view proposals and project progress
7. **Team Management Dashboard** - Proposal database access and project oversight for team members

## Prerequisites

* ✅ **Phase 2: Authentication & User Management** completed and its Progress Document (`Phase-2-Authentication-User-Management-Progress.mdc`) shows all DoD items verified
* ✅ **Authentication System Operational** - JWT auth, RBAC, user management fully functional and tested
* ✅ **Database Foundation** - SQLAlchemy models and database connection established
* ✅ **API Framework** - FastAPI backend structure and routing system operational
* ✅ **Version Control** - GitHub repository established with systematic commit history

## Assumptions

* **Authentication Foundation Stable** - Phase 2 auth system will remain stable during development
* **File Storage Approach** - Local file storage acceptable for MVP, cloud storage can be added later
* **AI Integration Method** - OpenAI API or similar service will be used for proposal generation assistance
* **Client Collaboration Level** - Basic client viewing and commenting sufficient for initial release
* **Performance Requirements** - Standard web application performance targets (< 2s page loads)

## Scope

### In Scope:

* **Project Management Models** - Project, Client, Proposal, ProjectPhase, Document database models
* **Project CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, delete projects with proper authorization
* **Proposal Generation System** - Template-based proposals with AI enhancement capabilities
* **Phase-Based Project Views** - Dynamic interfaces that change based on project phase
* **File Upload & Management** - Secure file handling with proper access controls
* **Client Portal Views** - Read-only project views for client users
* **Admin Project Dashboard** - Overview of all projects with management capabilities
* **Project Status Tracking** - Progress monitoring and status updates throughout phases
* **Basic Reporting** - Project metrics and status summaries

### Out of Scope:

* **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** - Detailed project analytics (deferred to Phase 4)
* **Real-time Collaboration Tools** - Live editing, chat, video calls (future enhancement)
* **Advanced AI Features** - Complex AI workflows beyond basic proposal assistance
* **Mobile Application** - Responsive web design only, native mobile apps deferred
* **Third-party Integrations** - External service integrations (CRM, accounting) deferred
* **Advanced Security Features** - Audit logging, advanced permissions (basic RBAC sufficient)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk:
* **AI Integration Complexity** - Proposal generation may require significant prompt engineering
* **File Management Security** - Ensuring proper access controls for uploaded documents
* **Performance with Large Projects** - Database queries may need optimization for projects with many documents

### Medium Risk:
* **User Experience Complexity** - Dynamic phase-based interfaces may confuse users
* **Data Model Evolution** - Project requirements may change during development

### Low Risk:
* **Authentication Integration** - Phase 2 provides solid foundation
* **Basic CRUD Operations** - Standard patterns from established frameworks

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach:
* **Block-Based Development** - 7 implementation blocks executed sequentially
* **Test-Driven Development** - Unit tests for all business logic components
* **API-First Design** - Backend APIs developed before frontend interfaces
* **Progressive Enhancement** - Start with basic functionality, add complexity incrementally

### Code Quality Requirements:
* **PEP 8 Compliance** - All Python code follows style guidelines
* **Type Hints** - Complete type annotations for all functions
* **Comprehensive Docstrings** - Google/NumPy style documentation
* **Error Handling** - Robust exception handling with proper logging
* **Security Validation** - Input validation and authorization checks

### Testing Strategy:
* **Unit Tests** - All service layer functions
* **Integration Tests** - API endpoint functionality
* **Security Tests** - Authorization and access control validation
* **User Acceptance Testing** - Real workflow validation with test scenarios
