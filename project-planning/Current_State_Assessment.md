# Current State Assessment

This document inventories the current state of the JDA AI Project Portal, mapping each required feature to its status, Definition of Done (DoD) compliance, and next steps. This assessment is strictly aligned with the documented requirements and phase plans to prevent scope drift.

## Next Steps
- Prioritize completion of in-progress features per phase plan
- Begin work on not started features in strict phase order
- Validate each feature against DoD before marking as complete
- Update this assessment after each major milestone
