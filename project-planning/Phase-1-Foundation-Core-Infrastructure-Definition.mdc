# Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure - Definition

## Overview

This phase focuses on establishing the foundational technical infrastructure for the JDA AI-Guided Project Portal. The goal is to create a robust, scalable foundation including development environment, core architecture, authentication system, database models, and basic API framework that will support all subsequent feature development phases.

## Objectives

1. **Development Environment Setup:** Configure complete development environment with Docker, database, and testing infrastructure
2. **Core Architecture Implementation:** Establish FastAPI backend with proper layered architecture and dependency injection
3. **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement secure user authentication with role-based access control (team vs client roles)
4. **Database Foundation:** Create core database models for users, projects, phases, and integration metadata
5. **API Framework:** Build RESTful API foundation with proper error handling, validation, and security middleware
6. **Testing Infrastructure:** Establish comprehensive testing framework with unit, integration, and security testing capabilities
7. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up automated testing and deployment pipeline for continuous integration

## Prerequisites

- **Project Planning:** `JDA-AI-Project-Portal-Initiation.mdc` and `JDA-AI-Project-Portal-Overview.mdc` completed and approved
- **Development Resources:** Development team access to AWS account, GitHub repository, and required development tools
- **API Access:** Preliminary API keys/access for Read.ai, OpenAI, and planned integrations (for testing environment setup)
- **Design Assets:** Basic UI/UX design system or style guide for consistent frontend implementation

## Assumptions

- **Technology Stack Stability:** FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, and AWS services will remain stable during development
- **Team Availability:** Development team has dedicated bandwidth for Phase 1 completion within estimated timeline
- **External Services:** Third-party APIs (Read.ai, OpenAI, Slack, Notion) will maintain stable interfaces during development
- **Security Requirements:** Standard enterprise security practices will be sufficient for initial client data handling
- **Infrastructure Access:** AWS infrastructure will be available and performant for development and testing environments

## Scope

### In Scope:

- **Backend Infrastructure:** FastAPI application with proper project structure, dependency injection, and configuration management
- **Database Design:** PostgreSQL database with core tables for users, projects, phases, tasks, integrations, and audit logging
- **Authentication System:** JWT-based authentication with role-based permissions (admin, team member, client roles)
- **API Foundation:** RESTful endpoints for user management, project CRUD operations, and basic health monitoring
- **Security Middleware:** Request validation, rate limiting, CORS configuration, and security headers
- **Testing Framework:** Unit testing with pytest, integration testing setup, and test database configuration
- **Development Environment:** Docker Compose setup for local development with all required services
- **Basic Frontend Setup:** React application skeleton with TypeScript, routing, and authentication integration
- **Documentation:** API documentation with FastAPI automatic OpenAPI generation and developer setup guides

### Out of Scope:

- **Advanced Features:** AI processing, external integrations, proposal generation (deferred to Phase 2+)
- **Production Deployment:** Production infrastructure setup and optimization (deferred to Phase 5)
- **Advanced Security:** Penetration testing, advanced threat protection (addressed in Phase 5)
- **Performance Optimization:** Detailed performance tuning beyond baseline requirements (Phase 5)
- **Mobile Applications:** Native mobile app development (not in current project scope)
- **Advanced Analytics:** Business intelligence dashboards and detailed reporting (Phase 4+)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks:
1. **Database Design Complexity:** Complex relationships between projects, phases, and integrations may require iterative design
   - **Mitigation:** Start with minimal viable schema, plan for database migrations, conduct early data modeling review

2. **Authentication Integration:** Role-based access control complexity may cause development delays
   - **Mitigation:** Use established authentication libraries (Auth0 or Firebase), implement progressive role complexity

3. **API Design Consistency:** Inconsistent API patterns may cause frontend integration issues
   - **Mitigation:** Define API standards document, use FastAPI automatic validation, conduct API design review

### Business Risks:
1. **Feature Scope Expansion:** Stakeholders may request additional features during foundation phase
   - **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to phase scope, regular stakeholder communication, defer enhancements to later phases

2. **Timeline Pressure:** Foundation work may seem slow to stakeholders expecting visible features
   - **Mitigation:** Regular demo of infrastructure components, clear communication of foundation importance

## Tasks & Implementation Plan

- Create user profile management endpoints
- Implement password hashing and security best practices

**Deliverables:**
- Complete authentication API endpoints
- User management system with role-based permissions
- Security middleware for protected routes

**Dependencies:** Block 1 completed (requires working FastAPI setup)
**Execute When:** User requests "Proceed to Block 2" after Block 1 completion

### Block 3: Core Database Models & APIs
**Tasks:**
- Design and implement core database models (Users, Projects, Phases, Tasks)
- Create project CRUD operations with proper authorization
- Implement phase management endpoints
- Add audit logging for all database operations
- Create data validation schemas with Pydantic

**Deliverables:**

## Execution Flow

**Flexible Execution Model:**
- **User-Directed:** Each block executes when you request it
- **Iterative:** We can revisit and refine blocks based on your feedback
- **Adaptive:** Can skip, reorder, or modify blocks based on priorities
- **Feedback-Driven:** Each block can be reviewed before proceeding to next

**Typical Flow:**
1. User: *"Start Block 1"* → I execute environment setup
2. User reviews → provides feedback/direction
3. User: *"Proceed to Block 2"* → I implement authentication
4. Continue pattern → flexible based on your schedule and priorities
