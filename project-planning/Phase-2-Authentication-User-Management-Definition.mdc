# Phase 2: Authentication & User Management - Definition

## Overview

This phase focuses on implementing the core authentication and user management system for the JDA AI-Guided Project Portal. The goal is to establish secure user authentication using JWT tokens, implement role-based access control (RBAC), and create comprehensive user management capabilities. This phase builds directly on the foundation established in Phase 1 and prepares the security framework for all subsequent phases.

## Objectives

1. **JWT Authentication System Implementation** - Create secure token-based authentication with refresh tokens
2. **User Database Models & Schemas** - Design and implement comprehensive user data models with SQLAlchemy
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Implement Admin, Project Manager, and Client roles with permissions
4. **User Registration & Login Endpoints** - Create secure registration and authentication API endpoints  
5. **Password Management System** - Implement secure password hashing, validation, and reset functionality
6. **User Profile Management** - Enable users to view and update their profile information
7. **Authentication Middleware Integration** - Secure existing and future API endpoints with authentication requirements

## Prerequisites

- **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure** completed and its Progress Document (`@Phase-1-Foundation-Core-Infrastructure-Progress.mdc`) shows all DoD items verified
- **Database connection operational** with PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy configured
- **FastAPI backend foundation** established with configuration management and logging
- **Environment configuration** system in place with JWT secret key support
- **Git repository** initialized and connected to GitHub for version control

## Assumptions

- **JWT token approach** is appropriate for the enterprise authentication requirements
- **PostgreSQL database** can handle user data with proper indexing and performance
- **Bcrypt password hashing** provides sufficient security for password storage
- **Role-based permissions** can be implemented with simple enum-based approach initially
- **Email verification** will be implemented in a future phase (not required for MVP)

## Scope

### In Scope:

- **User Model Implementation** with SQLAlchemy ORM including relationships and constraints
- **JWT token generation and validation** with access and refresh token support
- **Password hashing and verification** using bcrypt with proper salt rounds
- **User registration endpoint** with input validation and duplicate checking
- **User login endpoint** with credential verification and token generation
- **Role-based access control** for Admin, Project Manager, and Client roles
- **User profile endpoints** for viewing and updating user information
- **Authentication middleware** to protect secured routes
- **Database migrations** using Alembic for user tables
- **Unit tests** for authentication services and endpoints (per @automated-test-requirements-001.mdc)
- **API documentation** updates for authentication endpoints

### Out of Scope:

- **Email verification system** (deferred to Phase 3 or dedicated security enhancement phase)
- **OAuth2 integration** with third-party providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
- **Advanced password policies** beyond basic strength requirements
- **User session management** beyond JWT token lifecycle
- **Advanced audit logging** for authentication events (basic logging only)
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** implementation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk:
- **Security vulnerabilities** in authentication implementation - *Mitigation: Follow OWASP guidelines, comprehensive testing*
- **JWT token management complexity** - *Mitigation: Use proven libraries, implement proper token refresh*

### Medium Risk:
- **Database schema changes** affecting existing foundation - *Mitigation: Use Alembic migrations, test thoroughly*
- **Performance impact** of password hashing - *Mitigation: Use appropriate bcrypt rounds, monitor performance*

### Low Risk:
- **Role permission complexity** - *Mitigation: Start with simple role-based approach, iterate*
- **API endpoint integration** with existing structure - *Mitigation: Leverage established FastAPI patterns*
