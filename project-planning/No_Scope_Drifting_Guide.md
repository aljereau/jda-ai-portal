# No Scope Drifting Guide - JDA AI Project Portal

## 🎯 Purpose & Authority

This document serves as the **authoritative operational manual** for building the JDA AI Project Portal. As the expert programmer and AI agent responsible for implementation, I am bound by this guide to ensure:

- **Zero scope drift** - Only documented requirements are implemented
- **Systematic validation** - Every feature meets Definition of Done before progression
- **Rule compliance** - All work adheres to AI Development System standards
- **Evidence-based completion** - All claims of completion are backed by verifiable evidence

**Authority Level**: This guide overrides any ad-hoc requests or "quick additions" that are not formally documented and approved.

## 📋 Scope Boundaries (Immutable)

### ✅ **In Scope - Authorized for Implementation**
Reference: [Project_Overview_and_Scope.md](Project_Overview_and_Scope.md)

- Multi-source knowledge ingestion and AI-driven refinement
- Central, searchable knowledge base with tagging
- AI-assisted proposal generator with export capabilities
- Timeline/deliverables tracker (Gantt-style) with client interaction
- Integration management for external services
- Role-based access control and user management
- Notifications, activity feed, and audit logs
- Client portal for proposal/timeline viewing

### ❌ **Out of Scope - Prohibited Without Formal Approval**
Reference: [Project_Overview_and_Scope.md](Project_Overview_and_Scope.md#out-of-scope)

- Real-time collaboration (live editing)
- Mobile app development
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics beyond core dashboard
- White-label versions
- Invoicing integration
- Third-party API access

### 🚫 **Scope Drift Triggers (Red Flags)**
- "Just add this small feature..."
- "While we're at it, let's also..."
- "The client mentioned they might want..."
- "This would be easy to add..."
- "Let's make it more flexible by..."

## ✅ Validation Checkpoints & Evidence Requirements

### **Feature Completion Checklist**
Before marking any feature as complete, ALL items must be verified:

- [ ] **Requirement Mapping**: Feature maps to documented requirement in [Feature_and_Requirements_Spec.md](Feature_and_Requirements_Spec.md)
- [ ] **Rule Compliance**: All applicable AI Development System rules followed
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Passes all linting, type checking, and style requirements
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit tests >90% coverage, integration tests pass
- [ ] **Documentation**: Code documented, API docs updated, user docs current
- [ ] **Security**: No security vulnerabilities, access control verified
- [ ] **Performance**: Meets performance requirements (<2s response time)
- [ ] **User Validation**: Feature tested and approved by stakeholders (if required)

### **Phase Completion Checklist**
Before advancing to next phase, ALL items must be verified:

- [ ] **All Features Complete**: Every feature in phase meets completion checklist
- [ ] **DoD Verification**: All Definition of Done items documented and verified
- [ ] **Progress Documentation**: Phase progress document updated with evidence

## 🚨 Change Control Process

### **Authorized Change Types**
1. **Bug Fixes**: Fixing broken functionality within scope
2. **Clarifications**: Clarifying ambiguous requirements without adding features
3. **Technical Improvements**: Performance or security improvements within scope

### **Unauthorized Changes (Require Formal Approval)**
1. **New Features**: Any functionality not in [Feature_and_Requirements_Spec.md](Feature_and_Requirements_Spec.md)
2. **Scope Expansions**: Adding to existing features beyond documented requirements
3. **Architecture Changes**: Deviating from [System_Architecture_and_Technical_Design.md](../docs/System_Architecture_and_Technical_Design.md)
4. **Timeline Changes**: Altering [Phase_and_Iteration_Plan.md](Phase_and_Iteration_Plan.md)

### **Change Request Process**
1. **Document**: Log proposed change in "Proposed Changes" section below
2. **Justify**: Provide business case and impact analysis
3. **Review**: Assess against current scope and resources
4. **Approve**: Formal approval required before implementation
5. **Update**: Update all relevant planning documents

## 📈 Current State Tracking

### **Real-Time Status Reference**
- **Current Assessment**: [Current_State_Assessment.md](Current_State_Assessment.md)
- **Update Frequency**: After every major milestone or weekly
- **Validation**: Status changes require evidence and documentation

### **Progress Validation Protocol**
1. **Self-Assessment**: Check feature against completion checklist
2. **Evidence Collection**: Gather tests, docs, demos as proof
3. **Documentation**: Update progress documents with evidence
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Present evidence for validation (if required)
5. **Status Update**: Update Current_State_Assessment.md

---

## 🎯 Implementation Discipline

### **Daily Work Protocol**
1. **Start**: Review current phase definition and requirements
2. **Plan**: Identify specific tasks mapped to documented requirements
3. **Implement**: Follow all applicable AI Development System rules
4. **Test**: Validate against acceptance criteria and DoD
5. **Document**: Update progress with evidence
6. **Review**: Assess against scope boundaries before proceeding

### **Decision Framework**
For any implementation decision, ask:
1. **Is this required?** Does it map to a documented requirement?
2. **Is this in scope?** Is it within current phase boundaries?
3. **Is this compliant?** Does it follow all applicable rules?
4. **Is this validated?** Can completion be verified with evidence?

If any answer is "No" or "Unclear", STOP and clarify before proceeding.
